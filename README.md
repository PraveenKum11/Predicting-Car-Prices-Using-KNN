# Predicting Car Prices Using KNN
* This is a Guided project from DataQuest  
* In this project, we'll use machine learning workflow (K Nearest Neighbors) and try to predict a car's market price using its attributes.

# Conclusion :-
* By testing multiple sets of features and hyperparameter optimization I was able to reduce the RMSE to **3020.35**, the features used in this run were ['engine-size', 'horsepower', 'highway-mpg', 'city-mpg'] and K neighbors value was set to 9.
* Please checkout the solution notebook for in depth solutions, visualizations and other models.
